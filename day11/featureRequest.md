## Feature Request:
1. Promise Creation Script: Write a script that demonstrates creating and handling promises, including both resolved and rejected states.
2. Promise Chaining Script: Create a script that chains multiple promises and logs messages in a specific sequence.
3. Async/Await Script: Write a script that uses async/await to handle promises and includes error handling with try-catch.
4. API Fetch Script: Create a script that fetches data from a public API using both promises and async/await, and logs the response data.
5. Concurrent Promises Script: Write a script that uses Promise.all and Promise.race to handle multiple promises concurrently and logs the results.

## Achievement:
By the end of these activities, students will:
- Understand and create promises, including handling resolved and rejected states.
- Chain multiple promises to perform sequential asynchronous operations.
- Use async/await to handle asynchronous code more readably.
- Fetch data from public APIs using both promises and async/await.
- Manage multiple concurrent promises using Promise.all and Promise.race.
