## Feature Request:
1. Basic Error Handling Script: Write a script that demonstrates basic error handling using try-catch and finally blocks.
2. Custom Error Script: Create a script that defines and throws custom errors, handling them with try-catch blocks.
3. Promise Error Handling Script: Write a script that handles errors in promises using .catch() and try-catch within async functions.
4. Fetch Error Handling Script: Create a script that handles errors when using the fetch API to request data from invalid URLs.

## Achievement:
By the end of these activities, students will:
- Understand and implement basic error handling using try-catch blocks.
- Use finally blocks to execute code regardless of the try-catch outcome.
- Create and use custom error classes.
- Handle errors in promises using .catch() and within async functions using try-catch. Implement graceful error handling when making network requests with the fetch API.
